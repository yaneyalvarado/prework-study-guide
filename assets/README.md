## Description

I built this Prework Study Guide project to help me be succesful in the Coding Bootcamp. I learned the basics of HTML, CSS, JavaScript as well as the basics of Github. This project will allow me to solve problems when I am stuck and need a refresher, this will allow me to look back at my notes to ensure I am retaining all the information needed. I am highly-motivated for the Coding Bootcamp and what will keep me going is all the small milestones I have learned so far in the Precourse Work. I can't wait to learn more!
